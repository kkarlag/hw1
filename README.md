My test cases have printed expected outcomes. 
The first set of test cases show that my functions can handle empty lists.
The second test cases show that pushfront and pushback can handle more than
9 elements by creating another node.
I also showed that popback and popfront can handle the last element in a node 
by deleting the node. 
Lastly I showed that size works accurately.
